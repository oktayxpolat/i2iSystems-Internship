# Tracer Bullets

- When we want to test our code environment etc. we create some code which isn't the normal code but can be used too.
- In woodworking , we cut small pieces to see how it goes and we can use it later.
- While we are getting prepared for a cooking contest, we cook the food at home but with minimum amount.

# Prototyping

- When we want to create a car but do it with another material to see it physically, we prototype it.
- When we want to create an engine and want to test it, we create a small prototype which will actually not be used.
- When we construct a plane, the wings are prototyped.

# Orthogonality

- When we hold the pedals of bike, the wheels can still spin.
- When we remove one of the kidneys, the other one will still work.
- When we break car's windows, the car still works.
